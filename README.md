# mern-tutorial

This is a project I used for teaching myself MERN stack. It's a simple bug tracking system with all the CRUD functionalities.
Fork it have and learn yourself some MERN stack yea! If you are one of my people from DURO UAS when you're done 
with that I reccomend you go check out Flux and Redux.
